Analysis of data on influenza patients in the United States
there is also a Word document with explanation about the Analysis
In this project I predicted the number of people who would have flue in the USA. I dcided to predict this with Holt Winters method because I proved that flue is seasonal (more people had flue in the winter than in the summer). I also showed other possible methods wich was less affective.
